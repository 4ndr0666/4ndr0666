**Our Preferred Contact Method:**
Please send a detailed report to our dedicated security email:
**`01_dolor.loftier@icloud.com`**

### What to Include in Your Report:

To facilitate a swift understanding, reproduction, and remediation of the issue, please provide as much of the following information as possible:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** A clear and concise explanation of the vulnerability, including its nature and impact (e.g., client-side credit bypass, unauthorized feature access, data exfiltration).
*   **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed, step-by-step instructions that allow us or the affected vendor to reliably reproduce the issue. This is crucial for validation.
*   **Impact:** Describe the potential real-world consequences of the vulnerability (e.g., financial loss, unauthorized user actions, privacy breach, service disruption).
*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** Any relevant code snippets, scripts, or raw network logs (such as HAR files or structured outputs from tools like `Redteam Recon` or `ChimeraKit`) that demonstrate the vulnerability. Screenshots or screen recordings are also highly valuable.
*   **Affected Components:** Clearly identify the specific application, API endpoints, client-side code, or other assets impacted.
*   **Affected Versions/Environments:** Mention any specific versions, browsers, or environments where the vulnerability was observed.

## Our Commitment to Responsible Disclosure

We commit to a responsible disclosure process, which includes:

*   **Prompt Acknowledgment:** We (or the affected vendor, once connected through this channel) will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3-5 business days.
*   **Confidentiality:** We will keep your report strictly confidential and will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been remediated or a mutually agreed-upon disclosure timeline has been established.
*   **No Retaliation:** We do not condone legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in good faith and adhere to responsible disclosure principles.
*   **Seeking Fair Compensation/Recognition:** For significant findings, we will transparently pursue appropriate recognition, credit, or bug bounty rewards from affected vendors, where applicable.

**Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been remediated.** Avoid accessing or attempting to access data that does not belong to you, or disrupting services beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Thank you for your valuable contribution to building a safer digital ecosystem.
